"""Find the MID-360's IP on the wired LiDAR subnet so the driver config never needs editing.

A MID-360 is 192.168.1.1xx, where xx comes from its serial, so the address differs
per unit (192.168.1.125, 192.168.1.162, ...). The host side stays 192.168.1.10.

How it works, with no root needed: sending a UDP datagram to an address makes the
kernel ARP for it. A device that answers becomes REACHABLE in the neighbour table.

Only REACHABLE counts. STALE/DELAY entries keep an old MAC for hours (the kernel does
not garbage-collect a table this small), so a unit that was unplugged or swapped would
still look present. A stale entry that is really alive turns REACHABLE after the
kernel's probe (~5-6 s), which is why the wait is 8 s.

Set LIVOX_LIDAR_IP to skip the search and force an address.
