```

- **GLIM** is the SLAM: pose (`map → odom → base_link`) and a 3D map, from the MID-360's points
  and IMU. It runs on the CPU; the GPU is kept for depth and nvblox.
- **pcd2pgm** turns GLIM's 3D map into a 2D `/map` (fixed 50×50 m grid, 5 cm) for the global costmap.
- **nvblox** covers what the LiDAR can't see: the MID-360's field of view is −7° to +52°, so at
  0.60 m height its lowest beam reaches the ground ~4.9 m out, and anything shorter than
  `0.60 − d·tan 7°` at distance `d` (a 30 cm rock at 2 m) is invisible to it. The ZED, tilted
  down, is fused by nvblox into a 3 cm map in GLIM's `odom` frame, whose 2D slice feeds the local
  costmap.
- **waypoint_manager** (a GLIM extension) tags waypoints relative to GLIM submaps, so they move
  with loop-closure corrections. **waypoint_mission.py** drives to them through Nav2.

Everything runs in one Docker container (`kratos_glim`), started by `start.sh`.

## What starts

| Order | Component | Output |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | `livox_ros_driver2` | `/livox/lidar` (PointCloud2, 10 Hz), `/livox/imu` (200 Hz) |
| 2 | `lidar_angle_filter` | `/livox/lidar_filtered`: ±15° front and back removed (antenna) |
| 3 | `kratos_nav/nav.launch.py` | static TF `base_link → livox_frame`, `base_link → zed_camera_link`; Nav2 |
| 4 | GLIM (3 s later, after the static TF) | TF `map → odom → base_link`, `/glim_ros/odom`, `/glim_ros/map`, waypoint services |
| 5 | `pcd2pgm` (live) | `/map` |
| 6 | `kratos_perception` | ZED 2i, ESS, nvblox → `/nvblox_node/static_map_slice` |
| 7 | RViz (`kratos_bringup/rviz/kratos.rviz`) | only with a GUI |

Nav2 is 7 nodes (controller, smoother, planner, behaviors, bt_navigator, waypoint_follower,
velocity_smoother) started directly: Jazzy's `navigation_launch.py` also starts route, collision
monitor and docking servers that abort the bringup without their own config. Controller and
behaviors publish `cmd_vel_nav`; the velocity smoother publishes the final `/cmd_vel`.

Measured on the Orin with both sensors: GLIM odometry 10 Hz, its TF ~120 ms behind real time;
ZED 15 Hz; ESS ~40 ms/frame with TTA (processes ~11–15 Hz), ~20 ms without (27–28 Hz); nvblox
slice ~9–12 Hz; CPU 30–60 % per core, GPU ~37 %, RAM 11 GB of 62 GB.

## Known limits

- **Ramps:** nvblox (and the LiDAR layers) mark every surface 0.2–1.8 m above the *start* ground as
  an obstacle. A 10° ramp becomes a wall ~1.1 m up it (5°: 2.3 m); on a hill, ground can enter the band.
- **Ditches and drops are not detected** by any layer, and the planner allows unknown space
  (`allow_unknown: true`).
- **No relocalization:** waypoints and the map live only in the running GLIM session.
- **GLIM aborts on full LiDAR occlusion** (e.g. a hand over the sensor).
- **Fixed 50×50 m grid** around GLIM's start: size it to the arena.
- **ESS with TTA skips ~¼ of the camera's frames**; enough for the rover's speed.
- **Placeholders:** `lidar_z`, camera mount, footprint, grid size, turning radius.
- **Not tested on the moving rover yet.** Tested on the Orin: all of the above bring-up with both
  sensors (bench), and the hardware-free tests.
